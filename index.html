            <h2>DVA489 - Web security </h2>

            <p>
                Welcome to DVA489! This course is built around a number of assignments, where you develop, analyze, attack and patch your own web application. 
                The idea is that the interplay between development, attacking and protecting gives a deep understanding for why the attecks are possible, how to exploit them and how to protect against them. 
            </p>

            <p>
                After each assignment you will be provided with a link to an example application with a number of related secruity issues. The idea is that you use the knowledge you gained in the exercise to attack the application. Successful attacks will give you a proof of attack, that you hand in. The overall quality of your assignments and the number of successful attacks will be used in determining your ECTS grade.
            </p>

            <p> OBSERVE! We are currently in the process of revising parts of the course. This means that not all assignments will be available from the get go. 
                At the latest, the assignments will be made available in conntection to the corresponding introductory lecture.
             </p>

            <p>
                This course covers a lot of material. Some of it will be introduced in the introductory lectures, but
                you are required to do a lot of reading on your own. To your aid there will be links to relevant
                resources and you will have the opportunity to ask questions during our supervision sessions. If your
                questions cover a larger topic, please contact us in advance to allow us to prepare additional material.
            </p>

                This part consists of five applications with associated attacks. Each of the five parts should be
                equivalent
                to roughly 1 credit, corresponding to about 3 days of work. In order to gain full understanding
                of the attacks its important to understand the workings of the applications. Thus, you are going to
                develop the applications to
                attack yourselves.

            <h4>Example solutions</h4>

            To help you on the way
                there are relatively detailed assignment guides, with online example solutions. You are free to take
                inspiration from the example solutions
                in terms of the content they serve, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Indeed, the guides expect you
                to examine and reverse engineer their solutions. Feel free to take inspiration, or reuse and improve!
            </p>

            <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
                <h4 class="alert-heading">Example solutions</h4>
                <p>
                    You are allowed to use any information you can get from the example solutions, including the code if
                    you manage to successfully exploit them. I've made an effort to secure them, but there are no
                    guarantees!

            <h4>Early protection</h4>

            <p>
                Since you will be attacking your own web applications there is a risk that the code you write is not
                vulnerable to attack. The guides try to alleviate this problem by guiding you towards a believable
                solution containing common security flaws. The intention
                is that, if you follow the instructions closely without adding additional security measures of your own,
                you should end up with an application open to selected attacks.
            </p>

            <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                <h4 class="alert-heading">Early protection</h4>
                <p>
                    Abstain from prematurely hardening your application! This removes the fun of successfully attacking
                    the application!

            <h4>Use of 3rd party libraries</h4>

            <p>
                To ensure a detailed understanding of the inner workings of the vulnerabilities, and the protection mechanisms it is important you implement things yourselves. Thus, any use of NPMs that are not explicitly allowed is forbidden and will result in the rejection of the assignment.

                    Inclusion of libraries that are not part of the core nodejs runtime will result rejection of the assignment!

            <h4>Submission requirements</h4>

            <p>
                Please hand in attack reports and other documentation as separate pdf files and all source code in one zip file. Include both the original code to allow us to replicate your attacks, and the patched source code to allow us to verify 
                your protection mechanism and hunt for more ways to attack your code. Do not include the <code>node_modules</code>
                directory as it might contain binaries and will make the submission unnecessarily large. Instead, make sure to provide a <code>package.json</code> file that
                describes your project and all needed packages. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, the changes made to protect agains each attack should be commited in its own commit with a clear commit message. Repositories that only contain one big commit will be rejected.
