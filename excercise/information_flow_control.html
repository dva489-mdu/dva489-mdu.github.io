        <h2>Dynamic information-flow tracking</h2>

        <p>
            As was illustrated in the <a href="taint_tracking.html">dynamic taint tracking</a> exercise,
            taint tracking can be a valuable tool for prohibiting
            dangerous information flows in trusted programs. However, even trusted programs would still
            be susceptible to attacks relying on implicit flows. In case the program can be modified by the attacks
            as in the case with XSS taint tracking is easy to circumvent. The solution to this problem is
            to start tracking implicit flows in addition to explicit flows.
        </p>

        <h4>Tracking implicit flows</h4>
        <p>
            Tracking of implicit flows is typically done by associating a security level to the control flow. The
            label is frequently named the label of the <em>program counter</em> or <em>pc</em> for short. The idea
            is to raise the level of the pc to the level of the controlling expression in branches and loops,
            i.e., in the code which execution is controlled by the expression. Using JSFlow in full information-flow
            tracking mode we can inspect the label of the pc by printing. Consider the following example.
        </p>
        <pre>var x = lbl(true, 'secret');

if (x) print(true); else print(false);</pre>

        <p>
            Executing the program gives the following output, where the label of the pc of the <code>print</code>
            function is showed to the left of the output. This shows that the body of the conditional, i.e.,
            the <em>then</em> and the <em>else</em> is executed with the label of the pc set to the label of the
            controlling expression. The label is <code>secret</code> and we say that the body of the conditional is
            executed under <em>secret control</em>.
        </p>
        <pre>(&lt;secret&gt;):true_<>
</pre>

        <h4>Preventing dangerous flows</h4>
        <p>
            To prevent dangerous implicit flows
            side effects below the security level of the pc are disallowed, and causes execution to halt with a
            runtime security error. A side effect is below the security level of the pc if the value of the target of
            the side effect has a label that is less secret than the label of the pc. This definition presupposes an ordering
            on the security labels of the value, but such ordering exists naturally. Remember that JSFlow associates a
            set of security labels with each value; combining two labeled values resulted in a value with both labels.
            The natural ordering is, thus, subset inclusion, and writing below the pc means writing to a a target
            whose label does not include the labels of the pc. Let us return to the boolean leak of the
            <a href="taint_tracking.html">dynamic taint tracking</a> exercise.
        </p>

        <pre>var x = lbl(true, 'secret');
var y;

if (x) y = true; else y = false;

print(x);
print(y);</pre>
        <p>
            If we run the example with full information-flow tracking turned on we get the following result.
        </p>

        <pre>Ecma.prototype.DefineOwnProperty: security context &lt;secret&gt; not below existing value label <> for property y


monitor stack trace:
implicit.js:4:11
    true
</pre>
        <p>
            JSFlow tells us it has detected a potentially dangerous flow on line 4 of the program, where the <code>y</code>
            is assigned the value <code>true</code> under secret control. To remedy the situation we can upgrade the
            label of the value of <code>y</code> before writing to it under secret control. This could be done with
            the <code>lbl</code> function, but that would presuppose that we knew the label of the controlling expression
            statically. This is not always the case, and for this reason JSFlow provides an <code>upg</code> function
            that upgrades a value to the label of another value. The modified program becomes.
        </p>
        <pre>var x = lbl(true, 'secret');
var y = upg(undefined, x);

if (x) y = true; else y = false;

print(x);
print(y);
</pre>
        <p>
            Now, the label of <code>y</code> is upgraded to the label of <code>x</code> before entering the secret context
            and the assignment is allowed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Preventing side effects below the label of the pc is known as the <em>no secret upgrades</em> paradigm, and
            is one (of several) possible ways to handle implicit flows dynamically. Removing the restriction and allowing
            writes while upgrading the written target may seem like a better choice, but leads to a system that can
            be bypassed by an attacker. We refer the interested to the suggested literature for more information.

        <h3>Exercise 3</h3>
        <p>
            Exercise 3 consists of two tasks:
        </p>

            <ol>
        <li> Try to solve the following <a href="http://ifc-challenge.appspot.com/">information-flow control challenge</a>, where
            you are presented with different flawed protection systems that you should try to bypass in a way similar
            to what you did in  the <a href="taint_tracking.html">dynamic taint tracking exercise</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Based on <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~andrei/synasc16.pdf">Web Application Security using JSFlow</a>
            and the corresponding <a href="http://www.jsflow.net/SYNASC-2015.html">tutorial page</a> select one of the
            attacks in the course and explain how information-flow control could be used to prevent the attack.
        </li>
    </ol>

        <p>
