            <p>
                In <a href="../lab1/my_first_web_app.html">My first web application</a> and in
                <a href="../lab3/my_first_social_media_app.html">My first social media app</a> we met two variants of XSS and saw how to protect against them using various forms of sanitization. While it is important to strive to remove all vulnerabilities
                in an application it is also very demanding, in particular as the application grows.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a> is a security mechanism that can be used to prevent the exploitation of injection attacks by, e.g., constraining valid script sources and
                preventing unsafe inline scripts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your task is to use CSP to protect both <a href="../lab1/my_first_web_app.html">My first web
                    application</a> and
                <a href="../lab3/my_first_social_media_app.html">My first social media app</a> using CSP. Base your experimentation on the unpatched versions and show that your policy, indeed, protects the application from the attacks. Writing CSP policies
                for large web application is not an easy task as illustrated by <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub45542/">CSP
                    Is Dead, Long Live
                    CSP! On the Insecurity of Whitelists and the Future of Content Security Policy</a>. Follow the guidelines in the
                <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html">Content Security Policy Cheat Sheet</a>.


            </p>
            <h3>Excursion Result</h3>
            <p>
                The intended result of this excustion is two CSP policies and an attack report that shows how the policies protect from the reflected and stored XSS attacks.
