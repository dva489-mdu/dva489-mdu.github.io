        <h2>RegExp Denial of Service</h2>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS">RegExp Denial of Service (ReDoS)</a> is a relatively new attack type.
            The attack relies on using untrusted data
            to create a regular expression. Regular languages are recognizable in linear time, why it is easy to believe
            that this should hold also for all regular expression implementations. The problem is, though, that a naive regular expression
            implementation may exhibit exponential execution time!
        </p>

        <h3>The attack</h3>

        <p>
            The password quality checker of Squeak! is vulnerable to a ReDoS attack; it creates a regular expression from
            the username. Your first task is to use this vulnerability to take the server offline.
        </p>

        <h3>Protecting the application</h3>

        <p>
           In this particular case, the best way forward is to use a white list of allowed username characters.
            See, the OWASP <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html">Input Validation Cheat Sheet</a>.
        In general, it might be wise to escape data going into a regular expression. Another possibility is to
        use some form of regular expression validator, that tries to detect if the regular expression will exhibit
        bad execution time behavior.
