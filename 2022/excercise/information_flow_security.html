        <h2>Information security</h2>

        <p>
            In the setting of information flow security confidentiality and integrity are two key notions.
            In this setting,
            confidentiality means prohibiting secret or otherwise sensitive data from falling into the wrong hands
            while integrity means prohibiting illicit modification of application and user data.
            For instance, the <a href="../lab2/stealing_password_file.html">password file theft attack</a> is an example of
            a breach of confidentiality; the secret contents of the password file was transferred to the attacker
            by means of a path traversal attack.  Dually, the <a href="../lab4/cookie_integrity.html">cookie integrity attack</a>,
            and the <a href="../lab4/nosql_injection.html">NoSQL injection attack</a> are both examples of integrity breaches;
            untrusted information was allowed to enter the application and was used to make decisions in the program
            without further validation. In fact, the remainder of the attacks in this course can all be interpreted
            in terms of confidentiality and integrity.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most prevalent method for ensuring both confidentiality and integrity is access control. Access control
            assigns each user access right to every object of the system. The access right typically entails reading and writing
            permissions controlling the confidentiality and integrity aspects. Systems secured using access control puts
            an implicit trust in the user (whether its a human user or a program) not to misbehave once access has been
            granted. As has been illustrated time and time again such trust is frequently misplaced, in particular when
            the user is a program, that may contain bugs that allows an attacker to trick the program into doing
            unintended things. The initial four labs of this course illustrates the problem in a concise way. For this
            reason there is a growing realization that access control is not enough.
        </p>

        <h4>New kid on the block: information-flow security</h4>
        <p>
            Information flow security is a relatively new and active area of research. Unlike access control,
            information flow security does not simply relinquish the information after access has been granted,
            but continues to track how the information flows through the program during program execution focusing
            on the flow between sources and sinks. To ensure confidentiality information originating from sensitive
            sources (such as the password file) must be prevented from reaching attacker readable sinks (such as the
            reply from the web server). Dually, to ensure integrity information originating from untrusted (attacker
            controlled) sinks must be prevented from influencing the execution of the application (without proper
            validation).
        </p>

        <p>
            Information flow control can be enforced either statically (i.e., at compile time) or dynamically (i.e., at
            runtime). A popular method for static enforcement is via an information-flow type system. The type system
            guarantees that all well-typed programs are free from dangerous information flows. The popularity of
            dynamic languages like JavaScript has recently spurred an interest in dynamic information flow tracking, due
            to the difficulties involved in retrofitting a static type system on such languages. Dynamic information-flow
            tracking is similar to the dynamic typing present in, e.g., JavaScript. Instead only associating values
            with a runtime type values are also associated with a runtime security label. This label tracks the
            sensitivity of the value: its confidentiality, integrity or both. As the values flow through the program
            during the execution the security labels flow with them and are updated to reflect the computation of the
            program. This can be done in several ways leading to different notions of information-flow security with
            different security guarantees. On one extreme we find <em>taint tracking</em> with with relatively efficient
            enforcement, and on the other we find <em>full information-flow tracking</em> with more expensive enforcement.
