        <h2>Dynamic taint tracking</h2>

        <p>
            Taint tracking (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taint_checking">taint checking</a>) is a technique,
            where values originating from untrusted sources are tainted. The taint is then tracked during execution;
            if a tainted value is used in the computation of another value, the new value inherits the taint. Taint
            tracking was originally intended to protect the integrity of applications by prohibiting tainted
            values from ending up in sensitive parts of an application, e.g., SQL queries. Several languages like
            <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsec.html">Perl</a> or
            <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/security_rdoc.html#label-24SAFE">Ruby</a> incorporate
            taint tracking.
        </p>

        <p>
            Taint tracking is not limited to enforcing integrity. By generalizing the taint to a security label it's
            possible to track information from various sources. Such a generalization requires the possibility to
            combine security labels (if values with different labels are used to create new values). This can be done
            by ensuring that the labels form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)">lattice</a>, e.g.,
            by associating values with a set of labels. With this approach it is possible to prohibit values
            coming from untrusted sources from going to sensitive sinks (such as SQL queries) thus enforcing integrity
            and to prohibit values coming from secret sources from going to attacker readable sinks (such as the reply from
            the server) thus enforcing confidentiality.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting started</h3>

        <p>
            Download <a href="../resources/jsflow.zip">JSFlow</a> an information-flow
            aware interpreter for JavaScript that supports different levels of information-flow tracking. The instructions
            below will guide you through the process of getting JSFlow ready for experimentation. They are written from
            a Unix/Mac OS X perspective. If you run Windows there will be minor differences regarding paths, et.c.
        </p>

<p>
            JSFlow is
            written in JavaScript and requires <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>. To get JSFlow up and running,
            unzip the JSFlow archive, enter the <em>jsflow</em> directory and write.
        </p>
        <pre>npm install</pre>
        <p>
            This downloads the packages JSFlow needs into the <em>jsflow</em> directory. When this process has completed
            jsflow can be started by writing
        </p>
        <pre>./jsflow</pre>
        <p>
            This results in jsflow starting and entering its interactive mode as indicated by the jsflow prompt.
        </p>
        <pre>jsflow 1.1.0, :? for help
jsflow></pre>
        <p>
            In the interactive mode JavaScript code can be given on a line by line basis, exactly as in the interactive
            mode of Node.js. The example below defines and print a variable in two steps. The <em>undefined</em> is
            the value returned by the execution of the statements (for expressions, e.g, it would have been the value
            of the expression).
        </p>
        <pre>jsflow>var x = 5;
undefined
jsflow>write(x);
5
undefined_<></pre>


        <h4>Security labels and taint mode</h4>
        <p>
            JSFlow defaults to full information-flow tracking, but can easily be switched to taint mode by using
            the <code>--taint</code> switch when starting. It's also possible to toggle between full information-flow
            tracking and taint mode using <code>:taint</code> in interactive mode.
        </p>
        <pre>./jsflow --taint
jsflow 1.1.0, :? for help
jsflow>:taint
Taint mode off
jsflow>:taint
Taint mode on</pre>
        <p>
            With JSFlow in taint mode we can label values with security labels to indicate their origin, e.g.,
            <code>user</code> to indicate values originating from the user, or <code>password</code> to
            indicate a value coming from the password file. When using JSFlow to implement, e.g., a web server, such
            labels would be provided by the <em>security policy</em>. Since setting up JSFlow for such an implementation
            is out of scope for this exercise, we will instead experiment introduce labels by using the <code>lbl</code>
            function provided by JSFlow. With JSFlow in taint mode try:
        </p>
        <pre>jsflow>var x = lbl(5, 'user');
undefined
jsflow>print(x);
5_<user>
undefined_<>
jsflow>var y = lbl('fisksoppa', 'password');
undefined
jsflow>print(y);
'fisksoppa'_<password>
undefined_<>
</pre>
        <p>
            The example first declares variable <code>x</code> and assigns the value <code>5</code> labeled with
            <code>'user'</code> to it. To inspect the label of the value in <code>x</code> we can use the <code>print</code>
            function, that in addition to printing the value also prints the label (after the underscore). Similarly,
            we can create a value <code>'fisksoppa'</code> and label it with <code>'password'</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To illustrate how labels are tracked during computation we can try to create values using our previously
            introduced variable. Try, for instace, the following.
        </p>
        <pre>jsflow>var z = 'My password is: ' + y;
undefined
jsflow>print(z);
'My password is: fisksoppa'_<password>
undefined_<>
</pre>
        <p>
            As you can see from the output of the print, the string created by concatenating the string <code>'My password is:'</code>
            with the password makes the result inherit the label of the password. To see what happens when combining two labeled values, try:
        </p>
<pre>jsflow>var w = x + y;
undefined
jsflow>print(w);
'5fisksoppa'_<user,password>
undefined_<>
</pre>

        <p>
            As is clear from the output, the resulting string inherits the labels of both values used to create it, indicating
            that both a value originating from the user and from the password was used to create the value.
        </p>

        <h3>Limitations of taint-tracking</h3>

        <p>
            Taint tracking only tracks <em>explicit</em> flows, i.e., flows that come from direct manipulation of tainted
            values. In program analysis terms such flows are known as <em>data dependencies</em>. However, explicit
            flows do not capture all flows of information of programs. Another class of flows are the <em>implicit</em>
            flow, i.e., flow coming from the control flow. In program analysis terms such flows are known as
            <em>control dependencies</em>. Implicit flows may arise when the the control flow is dependent on tainted
            values, e.g., when branching or looping on a tainted value. To illustrate consider the two following
            examples. Both copy the content of the boolean variable <code>x</code> into variable <code>y</code> and
            print both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
        </p>

        <pre>var x = lbl(true, 'secret');
var y = x;

print(x);
print(y);</pre>

        <p>If we put the above code in a file <code>explicit.js</code> and execute it using JSFlow in taint mode,
        we get</p>

        <pre>./jsflow --taint explicit.js
true_<secret>
true_<secret>
</pre>
        <p>
            As you can see, the label correctly propagates with the value when it is stored into <code>y</code>.
            If we do the copying implicitly using differences in side effects when branching on the secret boolean
            the security label is lost.
        </p>

        <pre>var x = lbl(true, 'secret');
var y;

if (x) y = true; else y = false;

print(x);
print(y);</pre>

        <p>If we put the above example in a file <code>implicit.js</code> and execute it using JSFlow in taint mode,
        we get</p>

        <pre>./jsflow --taint implicit.js
true_<secret>
true_<>
</pre>
        <p>As is clear from the result, the label of the value store in <code>y</code> has been lost even though y
        is an exact copy of <code>x</code>! This illustrates why taint tracking can only be used to protect trusted
            code. If the attacker is in control of the code taint tracking can easily be circumvented using implicit flows.
        </p>

        <h3>Exercise 2</h3>
        <p>
            Exercise 2 consists of two tasks:
        </p>
            <ol>
        <li>Using JSFlow, Perl or Ruby experiment with explicit and implicit flows. Show how to create a function
            that takes any number and removes the taint using implicit flows. Report on your findings with a paragraph or two. </li>
        <li>Select one of the attacks in the course and explain how taint tracking could be used to prohibit the attack.</li>
    </ol>
