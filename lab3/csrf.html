        <h2>Cross Site Request Forgery</h2>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)">Cross Site Request Forgery
                (CSRF)</a>
            is an attack where a user is tricked by an attacker into performing
            a request to a site where the user is authenticated. This is possible due to the automatic passing
            of authorization information in every request done by, e.g., cookie-based sessions. CSRF attacks
            target state changing actions since the attacker has no way of getting the reply. As an example,
            the victim can be tricked into involuntary posting (e.g., free iPhone ads!)
        </p>

        <p>
            Unless protection mechanisms are in place it suffices that the victim visits a malicious site for the CSRF
            attack to take place. Social engineering is frequently part of CSRF attack, e.g., by sending malicious
            links or links to malicious sites or even ask the user to google for a special promo code.

        </p>

        <h3>The attack</h3>

        <p>
            In Squeak! there is no protection against CSRF attacks leaving the application wide open. The goal is to
            trick an authenticated user into posting the URL to the attack page. If other authenticated users click
            the URL they too will be victims of the CSRF.
        </p>

        <p>
            A first attempt at creating a CSRF attack would be to create a page with an AJAX call to
            <code>https://localhost:8000/squeak</code>. Fortunately, it's not that simple. Such attack attempt is
            thwarted by the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy"></a>
            Policy (SOP)
            that prevents cross-site AJAX, i.e., AJAX requests from one domain to another.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your first task is to try to craft a homepage that performs a CSRF attack against authenticated Squeak!
            users. When visiting the page an authenticated Squeak! users should involuntarily post a link to the
            attack page. The attack is illustrated below. First, <em>M. Sch&ouml;nfinkel</em> signs in to Squeak! (left).
            Second, <em>M. Sch&ouml;nfinkel</em> is tricked into visiting a malicious site while signed in to Squeak! (mid).
            Third, the malicious site has successfully used posted as <em>M. Sch&ouml;nfinkel</em> in Squeak! (right). The post
            contains a link to the malicious site. If any other user clicks the link they, too, become victims of the
            CSRF attack.

        </div>

        <h3>Protecting the application</h3>

        <p>
            The attack is made possible since cookies are always sent along with every request to a given domain,
            regardless if the request originates from the domain itself. There are several ways to prevent
            CSRF attack with different properties, strengths, and weaknesses. See the
            OWASP <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">Cross-Site Request Forgery Cheat Sheet</a>
            for more information.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your second task is to implement protection based on CSRF tokens. Associate each session with a randomly
            generated
            CSRF token, embed the token in a hidden token field in the squeak form, and verify that the token passed
            with
            the request corresponds to CSRF token of the session. Do you need to protect the <code>/signin</code>,
            <code>/signup</code> and <code>/signout</code> endpoints in the same way?

        </p>
