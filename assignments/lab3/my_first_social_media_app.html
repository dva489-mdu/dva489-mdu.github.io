        <h2>My first social media web application: Squeak!</h2>

        <p>
            In this assignment we will develop a simple social media application: Squeak!. Squeak!
            allows different users to post short squeaks of interesting information. The application
            features user registration and user-created content.
        </p>


        <div class="alert alert-danger " role="alert ">
            <h4 class="alert-heading ">Warning!</h4>
            <p>
                The final product of this is a web application intended to be open to attacks. The material presented in
                this assignment should not be seen as suggestions on how to build secure web applications. On the
                contrary, we have deliberately chosen some elements to make sure that the application contains security
                flaws! Bear in mind, though, that all of the questionable choices are choices that have occurred or even still occur 
                in the wild.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            After completion of the exercises you are expected to have a working, but flawed, authenticated social media
            web  application.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-warning " role="alert ">
            <h4 class="alert-heading ">Observe!</h4>
            <p>
                Since this is the third web application you develop (in this course), the instructions are a little
                more sparse. As before, feel free to reverse engineer the <a href=" ">example solution</a>, and
                take inspiration or reuse what you want. Note that signing up and squeaking (posting) are disabled in the
                example solutions for obvious reasons.

        <p>
            Unlike the previous two assignments, this time we will work with an existing web application framework,
            <a href="https://expressjs.com/ ">Express.js</a>. The framework provides convenient routing functions
            and a notion of <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html ">middleware</a>
            that makes it easy to introduce new functionality in the routing process.
            Using Express.js allows us to develop an understanding and
            appreciation for how the design of the framework imposes a certain structure on our solution that together
            with the provided functionality helps us avoiding many common mistakes. Use the excellent <em>Getting started</em>
            tutorial and the <em>Guide</em> provided on the Express.js homepage for more information.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-danger " role="alert ">
            <h4 class="alert-heading ">Warning: do not use any non-sanctioned libraries!</h4>
            <p>
                While Express.js is allowed no other 3rd party libraries are allowed. Using other libraries will cause the 
                assignment to be rejected without further comments.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-danger " role="alert ">
            <h4 class="alert-heading ">Warning: do not use any non-sanctioned middleware!</h4>
            <p>
                There is a lot of different middlewares and other utilities available for Express.js. You are <strong>not</strong>
                allowed to use any middleware that is not explicitly allowed on this page. In particular, you are not to allowed to 
                use any of the following middlewares:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>authentication and authorization middleware such as <a
                        href="http://www.passportjs.org/ ">Passport.js</a>,
                </li>
                <li>session handling middleware such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session ">express-session</a>,
                    or
                </li>
                <li>any templating engines such as <a href="https://mustache.github.io/ ">Mustache</a>.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>



        <p>
            Express.js will not appear
            entirely unfamiliar; many of the design choices of the previous assignments were borrowed from
            it. To install Express.js type <code>npm install express</code> in the application directory.
        </p>




        <h3>The server</h3>

        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Base your server implementation on the authentication and session management of assignment 2, but phrase the authorization 
            in terms of an Express.js middleware. It is strongly suggested you familiarize yourselves with the <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html">Routing</a>,
            the <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html">Writing middleware</a> and the 
            <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html">Using middleware</a> guides before creating your applications.
        </p>


        <p>
            The server should follow the structure of assignment 2 with some additions.
        </p>

        <table class="table ">
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col ">Path</th>

                <td>Directory with installed libraries. Will contain express and dependencies.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>templates/</td>
                <td>Directory with template files. Used to render HTML responses.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>passwd</td>
                <td>JSON encoded user information (user name and password).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>squeaks</strong></td>
                <td><strong>JSON encoded squeaks to retain state between server restarts.</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>httpd.js</td>
                <td>The web application implementation.</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
            The server should provide the following paths:
        </p>

        <table class="table ">
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col ">Method</th>

                <td>/</td>
                <td>Application main page. Returns the <em>sign in</em> page if no user is logged in and the <em>main
                    application</em> otherwise.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>POST</td>
                <td>/signin</td>
                <td>Accepts a JSON encoded username and password, and valides the session.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>POST</td>
                <td>/signup</td>
                <td>Accepts a JSON encoded username and password, adds the user if not present. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>POST</td>
                <td>/signout</td>
                <td>Invalidates the active session.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>POST</td>
                <td>/squeak</td>
                <td>Accepts an <em>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</em> squeak that is added to the other squeaks.
                </td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
            <code>/signin</code> and <code>/signup</code> accept a JSON encoded username and password, e.g.,
            <code>{ "username " : "daniel ", "password " : "skaldjur " }</code>,
            while <code>/squeak</code> accepts an <em>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</em> squeak. The rationale
            is that we want to use AJAX for signing in and signing up in order to not always trigger page reloads (e.g., when entering the wrong credentials) and, for
            simplicity,
            use a form to submit squeaks. The choice to use JSON is in line with modern web application APIs, while the
            choice to use <em>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</em> for <code>/squeak</code> is mandated by the use
            of a form to submit.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-success " role="alert ">
            <h4 class="alert-heading ">Suggestion: POSTing and receiving JSON</h4>
            <p>
                To receive JSON on the server-side use the <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express.json ">express.json()</a>
                middleware. This middleware decodes the body and stores the result in <code>req.body</code> if
                the content type of the request is set to <em>application/json</em>. This means that you have
                to make sure that the client request sets this header properly (<a
                    href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ ">jQuery.post</a>
                defaults to <em>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</em>) otherwise the middleware will fail to decode the
                body for you!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-success " role="alert ">
            <h4 class="alert-heading ">Suggestion: receiving <em>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</em></h4>
            <p>
                To receive <em>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</em> on the server-side use the
                <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express.urlencoded ">express.urlencoded()</a>
                middleware.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Authentication and authorization flow</h3>

        <p>
            The authentication and authorization flow follows the one of assignment 2, with some additions. The flow is described in 
            brief below; see assignment 2 for the details if needed.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Authentication is username and password based.</li>
            <li>Authorization is session based using a session cookie <code>squeak-session</code> containing a JSON
                object with the session identifier and the username, e.g., <code>{ "sessionid " : "... ", "username " : "A. Church " }</code>
            </li>
            <li>Successfully signing in validates upgrades the pre-session to a valid session.</li>
            <li>The server keeps track of valid sessions.</li>
            <li>Sessions are terminated if the user signs out or if the session expires.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To handle authorization it's very convenient to create your own session middleware. This middleware
            looks for the <code>squeak-session</code> cookie, parses it as a JSON object using <code>JSON.parse()</code>
            and verifies that the associated session identifier is valid. In case of a valid session the middleware stores
            the session information (the identifier and the username)
            in <code>req.session</code>. This way protected end-points can simply look for the presence of <code>req.session</code>
            and use the information contained there in to authorize. See the express.js guide on
            <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html ">writing middleware</a> for information on
            how to write middleware.
        </p>

        <h3>Application main page</h3>

        <p>
            The application main path <code>/</code> checks the session information provided by the session middleware.
            If a valid session
            is present the application main page is generated from the list of squeaks giving, e.g.,
            the result shown above.
            If the session middleware has signaled that there is no valid session the user
            is presented with a combined sign in and sign up page.
        </p>

        <img src="squeak-login.png " class="img-responsive ">


        <h3>Signing in</h3>

        <p>
            To sign in a user enters his credentials and presses the sign in button. The credentials are sent to the
            server using the <a href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ ">jQuery.post</a> method. The server checks the
            credentials against its user database and responds with a JSON encoded boolean that indicates if the
            operation
            was successful or not. In addition, in case of a successful sign in, a new random session identifier is
            allocated and stored in the server's session state. As before, we store the session identifier in a cookie,
            e.g., <code>squeak-session</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            If the client receives <code>"false"</code> the sign in failed, which is communicated to the user by
            setting the color of the border of the username and password fields to red. This is done by adding the CSS
            class
            <code>is-invalid</code> to the input element. See the Boostrap description of
            <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#server-side ">server-side form validation</a>
            for more information.
        </p>

        <img src="squeak-failed-login.png " class="img-responsive ">

        <p>
            If the client receives <code>"true"</code> the sign in was successful and the page should be reloaded.
            Refreshing
            the page in the context of a new valid session results in the main page being rendered. To reload the
            page using JavaScript use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/reload ">location.reload()</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Signing up</h3>

        <p>
            In order to participate, users must sign up. Signing up requires you to chose a name and a password.
            When a user tries to sign up the following security checks are performed by the server
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>the name is at least four characters long</li>
            <li>the name is not already taken</li>
            <li>the password is at least eight characters long</li>
            <li>the password does not contain the name</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Further checks are possible, but we will let this suffice. </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Checking the username.</strong> In case the name is invalid or taken the
            server responds with JSON encoded data that identifies that the operation failed and that it was the
            username that was the culprit. The client uses this information to signal the error using the form.
        </p>

        <img src="squeak-invalid-username.png " class="img-responsive ">

        <p>
            <strong>Checking the password.</strong>
            To check if the username is part of the password we are going to create a regular expression of the username
            and test the password using the regular expression. Assuming the username is in the variable
            <code>username</code>
            and the password is in the variable <code>password</code> use the following code to verify the password
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript ">let validPassword = password !== undefined && password.length >= 8;

if (validPassword) {
  let nameregex = new RegExp(username);
  validPassword &= !nameregex.test(password);
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            If the password is invalid the server responds with JSON encoded data
            that identifies that the operation failed and that it was the password that was the culprit.
            The client uses this information to signal the error using the form.
        </p>

        <img src="squeak-invalid-password.png " class="img-responsive ">

        <p>
            The structure of the server response is unimportant as long as the client is able to differentiate between
            a successful operation, a failed operation due to the username and a failed operation due to the password.
            The details are left to your discretion.
        </p>

        <p>
            If the operation succeeds, the sign up creates a new user and stores it in its user database both in memory
            and on disk. The password should be stored salted and hashed! Thereafter a new random session identifier is
            and sent back using the <code>squeak-session</code> cookie. As with a successful sign in, the client should
            reload the page using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/reload ">location.reload()</a>.
        </p>


        <h3>Squeaking</h3>

        <p>
            Once a user is signed in the application main page generated and rendered. The page contains a form
            for submitting new squeaks, a sign out button, and the squeaks so far. Note that the squeak form
            contains the name of the user. The generation is server-side and uses the name associated with the session
            and a list of squeaks. Each squeak contains the name of the
            squeaker, the time of the squeak and the squeak itself.
        </p>

        <img src="squeak-squeaking.png " class="img-responsive ">

        <p>
            After having typed in the next squeak the user can either press the <em>Squeak!</em> button or press enter.
            This will cause the form to be submitted to the server. On reception, the server checks the session
            information provided by the session middleware. If no valid session is present the server simply drops the
            squeak and ends the request. Otherwise, a new squeak is created (containing the username, the time for the
            squeak and the contents of the squeak) and is stored in memory and on disk. The server then responds
            with a <code>302</code> redirect to <code>Location : /</code> to trigger a reload of the page without
            modifying the URL.

        <h3>Signing out</h3>

        <p>
            The application main page contains a sign out button that invalidates the session by removing the session
            identifier from the list of valid sessions. The button uses <a href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ ">jQuery.post</a>
            to post to <code>/signout</code> and then reloads the page using
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/reload ">location.reload()</a>
            to display the sign in page. It would have been equally possible to use the button to submit the form, but
            then the server would have had to respond with a <code>302</code> redirect to <code>Location : /</code>.

            The application should be similar to the <a
                href="https://dva446.herokuapp.com/lab3 ">example application</a> and should follow the structure
            mandated by this document. If you want to try it out you can log in using the names of the participants in
            the screenshots (mind the spaces! and password <code>12345678</code>! Notice that, for security reasons, squeaking and user
            registration are disabled in the example application.
