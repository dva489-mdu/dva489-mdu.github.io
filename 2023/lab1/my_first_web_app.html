                This laboration introduces modern web development with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a>. We
                will cover the following topics: how to serve static files, how to send information back to the server
                using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET">GET</a> and <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">POST</a>, and finally, how to
                build a minimal web application.
            </p>

                    The final product of this is a web application intended to be open to attacks. The material
                    presented in this laboration should not be seen as suggestions on how to build secure web
                    applications. On the contrary, we have deliberately chosen some elements
                    to make sure that the application contains security flaws!

            <h2>Creating a web server</h2>

            <p>For this lab we will be using the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html">HTTP</a> library that
                provides support for both HTTP servers and HTTP clients. Implementing support for HTTP/1.1 is complex
                and error-prone. In particular, the library
                provides support for
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keepalive session</li>
                <li>(Efficient) chunked data transfer</li>
                <li>Rudimentary message parsing</li>
            </ul>


            <p>The following program creates a server. The
                <a
                    href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_options_requestlistener">createServer</a>
                method takes a callback, a request listener, that is given the incoming request message,
                <code>req</code>, and the server response,
                <code>res</code>. The request listener is invoked for every
                <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_request">request</a> event.
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log(req.method + " " + req.url + " " + req.httpVersion);
  res.end();
});

server.listen(8000);</code></pre>

            <p>This server listens to port 8000, and prints the method, the url and http version of all incoming
                requests. In order for the client not to hang, it terminates the request without sending back any
                information.
            </p>
            <p>Save the code to file <code>httpd.js</code> and start it using <code>node httpd.js</code>. Navigate to
                the server using the URL <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>. This should yield
                a blank page in the browser and
                the following output from the server.
            </p>
            <pre>
$ node httpd.js

                Does the exact path of the URL matter? Try, e.g.,
                <a href="http://localhost:8000/does/the/path/matter">http://localhost:8000/does/the/path/matter</a>.

        </div>



        <div class="page-header nobreak">

            <h2>Serving content</h2>
            <p>
                The most basic functionality of a web server is to serve content. To request a resource from a web
                server the <code>GET</code> method is used together with a URL that locates the resource on the server. As we saw above, the request URL is accessible from the request object via the <code>url</code> property.
                In
                the most simple form, a static web
                server translates the URL to a file in the file system that is returned as the result of the request.
            </p>

            <p>
                When returning a resource from a web server it is important to let the browser know what kind of
                resource is being returned. This can be done by specifying a MIME type in the <code>Content-Type</code>
                response header. A common way for
                a generic static web server is to tie file extensions to mime types as exemplified by the following
                table (non-exhaustive):
            </p>

            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>extension</th>
                        <th>MIME type</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>.html</td>
                        <td>text/html</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>.css</td>
                        <td>text/css</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>.js</td>
                        <td>text/javascript</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>Exercise 2: a static web server</h3>
            <a name="exercise2"></a>
            <p>
                In this exercise, we will create a web server that serves files from a dedicated directory called
                <em>public</em>. The file system structure of the web server will be as follows.
            </p>

            <table class="table table-borderless">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="col">Path</th>
                        <th scope="col">Description</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>public/</td>
                        <td>Directory with static files served by the static fallback.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>httpd.js</td>
                        <td>The web server implementation.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
                Populate the <em>public</em> directory using the following using the <a
                    href="../resources/public.zip">public.zip</a> archive that contains a <a
                    href="http://getbootstrap.com">Boostrap</a> based page, which we will use as the basis for
                further development in addition to a few selected pictures of Icelandic volcanoes. Visiting the web server should render the page below. 
            </p>

            <img src="lab1-exercise2.png" class="img-responsive">

            <p>
                In addition to serving static files, the web server should handle request paths that resolve to
                directories in the following manner:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>if the directory contains an <code>index.html</code> file, serve the contents of that file</li>
                <li>if the directory does not contain an <code>index.html</code> file, serve a directory listing</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Letting the server render a directory listing with link allows us to use the web server as a simple file server. This is a relatively feature of many web servers, e.g. the Apache web server. For examples use the following link to search for images matching the search term <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=561614363&hl=en&sxsrf=AB5stBhVoS8eCp2RtlI4rA5YyX1YMBOTdw:1693485583406&q=apache+directory+listing&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj07YW19YaBAxVRYPEDHdepBMgQ0pQJegQIDhAB&biw=1427&bih=827&dpr=2">"apache directory listing"</a>. 
            </p>

            Note that the URL the server receives may contain 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">percent-encoded</a> characters. To be able to
            properly use such URLs you must decode them before use. This can be done using the
            <code>decodeURIComponent</code>.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-javascript">let path = decodeURIComponent(req.url);</code></pre>
        <p>
            In this simple example, we know that the url only contains the path to the requested object. More generally, the URL can contain several different things, and decoding would be done on the various URL components after parsing the URL (as indicated by the name of the decode function). 
        </p>

            <p>
                Start and test the server by connecting to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>.
                It should behave similarly to the <a href="https://dva446.herokuapp.com/lab1/exercise2">example
                    solution</a>. Make sure that you can list all the <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/icelandic volcanoes/</a> and view the pictures by clicking the links.

            <h2>Sending information to the server</h2>

            <p>
                The <code>GET</code> method is intended to be used to retrieve a resource from the server, e.g., and
                html page, a css document or a picture. Requesting a resource using <code>GET</code> should not modify
                the state of the server; browsers
                will assume that using <code>GET</code> is idempotent and will resubmit requests without asking.
            </p>
            <p> In addition to the requested resource, the URL of a <code>GET</code> request may pass information about
                the request in terms of the query parameters. The query parameters follow a ? at the end of the URL and
                consists of a &amp; separated sequence
                of name=value pairs and is sent as part of the request header.
            </p>
            <pre>http://localhost:8000/index.html?parameter1=value1&amp;parameter2=value2</pre>

            <p>
                As an example, Google uses the query string to pass users search queries, which allows linking to a
                specific search, e.g.,
                <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nodejs">https://www.google.com/search?q=nodejs</a> which
                represents a Google search for Node.js.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code>POST</code> method is intended to be used to send information to the server, e.g., submitting
                a form, placing an order or posting a comment. The main difference between <code>POST</code> and
                <code>GET</code> is that <code>POST</code> is not supposed to be idempotent and will not be
                automatically resent by the browser. Instead, the browser typically asks the user if the form should
                resubmitted or not.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code>POST</code> data is sent in the message body, and may be encoded in a number of different
                ways, including being split up into multiple chunks sent one by one.
            </p>

            <h3>Exercise 3: experimenting with request methods</h3>
            <a name="exercise3"></a>

            <p>
                To experiment with sending and receiving information, we are going to add a form to <code>POST</code>
                information back to the server.
            </p>

            <img src="lab1-exercise3.png" class="img-responsive">

            <p>
                Modify <code>index.html</code> file to include a
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Your_first_HTML_form">form</a> to be
                able to experiment with the POST method.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;form action=&quot;index.html&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
        &lt;label for=&quot;email&quot;&gt;Email address&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; name=&quot;email&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;email&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter email&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
        &lt;label for=&quot;password&quot;&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;password&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;password&quot; placeholder=&quot;Password&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>

            <p>
                When submitted the form sends the values of its <em>named</em> input and button elements to the location
                specified by the <code>action</code> attribute. If no method and enctype is specified
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">POST</a> is used and the
                information is transferred <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>i.e., as a sequence of
                key/value pairs stored in the body. Forms
                are submitted when an <em>input</em> or <em>button</em> element of type
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit">submit</a> is clicked.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now modify the static web server to print method, url, content type, and request body on the console.
                The method and the url are directly accessible on request object, while the request body has to be read
                from the request object using the fact that it
                implements
                <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable">Readable
                    Stream</a> with a <em>data</em> and an <em>end</em> event.
            </p>


            <p>
                Start and test the server by connecting to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>.
                It should behave similarly to the <a href="https://dva446.herokuapp.com/lab1/exercise3">example

            </p>
            <p>
                Experiment with different query strings. Are they modified by the browser in any way? What about the
                form data? What happens if you reload the result of posting? Identify how the information the browser
                sends is made available to the server.
            </p>

            <h2>Creating a web application</h2>
            <p>
                While a simple web server serves static pages, a web application relies on the generation of dynamic
                content. The generation can be done on the server-side or on the client-side with different benefits.
                For instance, client-side generation relieves the
                server from computation, potentially lowering its load, but exposes the content generation and the data
                needed for the generation. On the other hand, server-side generation allows the application to hide how
                the content is generated, while
                potentially imposing a greater load on the server. Further, client-side generation has the benefit of
                not requiring a reload of the resource to update it to reflect changes - it's simply a matter of
                updating by querying the data. For this
                reason, many web applications employ a hybrid of server-side and client-side generation, where the
                server generates some of the content and the client maintains an updated view of the data by querying
                the server using, e.g.,
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX">AJAX</a>.

            <h4>Path routing</h4>

            <p>
                Regardless of whether the content is generated on the server-side or the client-side the resources are
                located via a URL. This makes the web application more complex than a simple web server. Where the web
                server translates the request path into a file
                system location and serves the corresponding file, a web application must handle requests in a more
                complex way, e.g., by translating the request into
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>a file system path for serving static files, e.g., style sheets</li>
                <li>a generating function used to generate the response on the server-side</li>
                <lo>a resource used to dynamically generate (parts of) the application on the client-side</lo>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This problem is generally known as routing, and refers to the process of deciding how to handle a
                request based on the <em>request method</em> and <em>request path</em>.
            </p>

            <h3>Exercise 4: generated content</h3>
            <a name="exercise4"></a>
            <p>
                The goal of this exercise is to create a web application that displays information about the request it
                received. For simplicity, we will only display the method, the path and the query parameters.
            </p>

                Extend the web server of <a href="#exercise2">exercise 2</a> with routing by allowing the association of
                a method and request path to a handling function. When a request is received use the method and the
                request path to find the associated
                function. If such a function exists call it providing the request and the response objects. If no
                function is associated with the request use the static web server to respond to the request. This is
                needed in order to keep serving the
                static parts of the web application.

            <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
                <h4 class="alert-heading">Suggestion: routing table and handler functions</h4>
                <p>
                    I suggest that you create a routing table that associates a path with a handler function together
                    with a simple routing function, <code>function route(req, res)</code>, that tries to find the
                    appropriate handler, falling back on the
                    static server if no handler is found.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let the handler function take the request and response object as parameters, e.g.,
                    <code>function information(req, res) { ... }</code>. This way the handler has access to the full
                    request and is able to generate an appropriate answer using the response object.
                </p>
            </div>


            <p>
                Associate the request path <code>/information</code> for any request method to a function that generates
                a reply based on an <a href="information.template">html template</a>, where <code>{{name}}</code> marks
                named holes. Download and
                place this template into a <em>template</em> directory in your web application, giving the following
                application structure.
            </p>



            <table class="table table-borderless">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope="col">Path</th>
                        <th scope="col">Description</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>public/</td>
                        <td>Directory with static files served by the static fallback.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>templates/</strong></td>
                        <td><strong>Directory with template files. Used to render HTML responses.</strong></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>httpd.js</td>
                        <td>The web server implementation.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>



            <p>
                The intention is to generate the response by loading the template as a string, replace the named holes
                with the appropriate information using the String method
                <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace">replace</a>
                and return the result as the response. Replace the placeholders as follows.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>replace <code>{{method}}</code> with the request method
                </li>
                <li> replace
                    <code>{{path}}</code> with the request path
                </li>
                <li> replace
                    <code>{{query}}</code> with the query string
                </li>
                <li> replace <code>{{queries}}</code> with a sequence of two column table rows, one for each query
                    parameter.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                You can use <a
                    href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/url.html#url_url_parse_urlstring_parsequerystring_slashesdenotehost">url.parse</a>
                function to parse the url to get the request path and the query string. If you supply <code>true</code>
                as the second argument, i.e., <code>url.parse(req.url, true)</code>, the query string will be parsed.
                The result of parsing the query string is a map from names to values, which is available via the
                <code>query</code> property on the result of the parsing. Don't forget to decode components resulting from parsing the url using <code>decodeURIComponent</code> before using them.
            <p>
                Start and test the server by connecting to
                <a href="http://localhost:8000/information">http://localhost:8000/information</a>. It should behave
                similarly to the <a href="https://dva446.herokuapp.com/lab1/exercise4/information?q1=v1&q2=v2">example
                    solution</a>. Try accessing the
                application with different query strings.
            </p>
