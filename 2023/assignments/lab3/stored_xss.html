            <h2>Stored XSS</h2>

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)">Cross-site Scripting</a> (XSS) attacks are code injection attacks where data is injected into the web application in such a way it is executed on the victim's machine.
                The malicious content is frequently JavaScript but is certainly not limited to it. Any content, e.g., Flash, that is executed on the victim's machine can be used. In this attack, however, we will focus on JavaScript injection.
            </p>

            <p>
                This time we will use a stored XSS attack to steal the session cookie! A stored XSS attack is a particular form of XSS attack relying on the attacker being able to inject content that is later served back to users without filtering or escaping. We will
                access the cookies via
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie">document.cookie</a> and sends it along with the username to a remote paste server.
            </p>


            <h3>The attack</h3>

            <p>
                In Squeak! you have the ability to post squeaks that. If you implemented Squeak! according to the specification, the posts are not filtered and not escaped, which leaves the application wide open for XSS attacks. If you implemented filtering or escaping,
                well done - now turn it off for the attack to work!
            </p>
            <p>
                Your first task is to try to craft a squeak that opens an alert window by injecting
                <code>&#x3C;script&#x3E;alert(&#x27;Owned&#x27;);&#x3C;/script&#x3E;</code>. This should be really straightforward. After you have successfully done so the browser will reload the page and the alert should be visible. Any subsequent reload
                of the page should also trigger the alert, e.g., when another user logs in as illustrated below, where <em>M. Sch&ouml;nfinkel</em> gets owned by an attack previously posted by <em>L. E. J. Brouwer</em>. First, <em>L. E. J. Brouwer</em>                posts the attack (upper left, masked). Then,
                <em>M. Sch&ouml;nfinkel</em> logs in (upper right), gets owned (lower left) and gets into the application, where he can see the message left by <em>L. E. J. Brouwer</em> (lower right).
            </p>


            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <a href="stored-xss-attack-large.html"><img src="stored_xss/squeak-attack-brouwer.png" class="img-responsive"></a>
                </div>

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <a href="stored-xss-attack-large.html"><img src="stored_xss/squeak-attack-logged-in.png" class="img-responsive"></a>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Your second task is to device attack code that steals
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie">document.cookie</a> and sends it along with the username to <code>https://dva446.herokuapp.com/store/ID</code>, where you can select a unique ID (in order to not
                interfere with the other users). Any content in the body of a POST will be added to the ID, which can be viewed using GET to the very same address. Use this to steal the session of one of your users!
            </p>


            <h3>Protecting the application</h3>

            <p>
                The attack is made possible since the application allows unescaped untrusted data into an HTML element. Your task is to implement protection against stored XSS in the application. You will do this in two ways.
            </p>

            <h4>#1: Escape all untrusted data</h4>
            <p>
                Read the OWASP <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet</a> to understand where and when escaping is needed. Escaping is notoriously difficult
                to get right. Instead of relying on your own escaping we are going to use one of the popular templating engines: <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>. Mustache automatically escapes all data when generating pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reimplement your application using <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>. This should be relatively straightforward since the templating functionality we implemented is compatible with Mustache. Use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mustache-express">mustache-express</a>                to use Mustache with Express.js. The Express.js home page contains a guide on how to <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html">use template engines</a>. Note: it seems that <em>mustache-express</em> requires
                templates to be named <code>.mustache</code> in order for it to find them.
            </p>

            <h4>#2: Protect the session cookie</h4>
            <p>
                Make sure that the session cookie is secure by setting the attribute <em>HttpOnly</em>, which causes the cookie to be inaccessible from JavaScript. Further, set the attribute <em>Secure</em>, which causes the cookie to only be set if transferred
                over SSL. Read more about attributes that can be set using
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie">Set Cookie</a>.
            </p>
