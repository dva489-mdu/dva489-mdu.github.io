        <h2>My first authenticated web application, @home</h2>

        <p>
            In this laboration you will create a minimal mock-up home monitor web application with rudimentary
            authentication and authorization.
        </p>

        <p>
            The laboration is built up by two parts. In the first part, we build the core
            application that allows us to read the temperature and control the lights.
            In the second part, we add authentication to prevent unauthorized access to the application.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Warning!</h4>
            <p>
                The final product of this is a web application intended to be open to attacks. The material presented in
                this laboration should not be seen as suggestions on how to build secure web applications. On the
                contrary, we have deliberately chosen some elements to make sure that the application contains security
                flaws!
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            After completion of the exercises you are expected to have a working, but flawed, authenticated web
            application.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-header nobreak">

        <h2>Creating the unauthenticated @home app</h2>

        <p>
            The initial application consists of a single page displaying the temperature of the different rooms, the
            status of the different lights in the rooms, and some means of controlling the light.
            Your task is to create a web application that behaves similarly to the <a
                href="https://dva446.herokuapp.com/lab2/exercise1">example application</a>.
        </p>


        <img src="exercise1/athome-main.png" class="img-responsive">

        <p>
            In the example application,
            the temperature is displayed as a <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/badge/">badge</a> on
            the
            header displaying the room name, and the lights are represented as <a
                href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/buttons/">buttons</a>, where the color of the button
            indicates whether the light is on or off. Clicking the light buttons
            should toggle the light state.
        </p>

        <p>
            The application consists of the server, the program running on the server side, and the client,
            the content downloaded and displayed or executed by the browser. To increase
            the responsiveness of the application, the client part contains code that asks the server for the state of
            the temperature
            sensors and lights at regular intervals, rather than just having the server embed this information when
            loading the
            app.
        </p>


        <h3>The server</h3>

        <p>
            Base the application on the final product of laboration 1, which has the following application structure
            on the file system.
        </p>

        <table class="table table-borderless">

        <h4>Routing and application paths</h4>
        <p>
            This time
            around the routing is a bit more complex since we need to route based on both the request method as well
            as the request path. Since we cannot work with actual devices we will use a mock-up
            data model containing the states of the various devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application relies on the following paths in addition to the static routing. The application main page
            is associated with the <code>/</code> path and is generated from a template to include the current status
            of all the sensors. The client should regularly update the status of the lights and the values of the
            temperature sensors by sending
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX">AJAX</a> GET requests to
            <code>/:room/lights/:light</code>, where <code>:room</code> represents the room name, and
            <code>:light</code>
            represents the light name, and similarly for <code>/:room/temperature</code>. The response to such requests
            is a
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON">JSON</a> encoding of
            the sensor state. To switch the light on and off the client sends
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX">AJAX</a> POST requests to
            <code>/:room/lights/:light</code>. The response to such requests
            is a
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON">JSON</a> encoding of
            the new sensor state.

        <h4>Responding to requests</h4>
        <p>
            GET requests to the corresponding
            application paths listed above should return a <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON">JSON</a> encoding of
            the device state as defined by the data model. You can use the <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify">JSON.stringify</a>
            function to create a JSON string from a JavaScript value.
        </p>

        <p>
            POST request to the corresponding light paths listed above should flip the state of the light in the data
            model
            and return a JSON encoding of the new state of the light, used by the client to
            update its display.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Suggestion: routing tables</h4>
            <p>
                Use two routing tables: one for GET requests and one for POST requests and select the appropriate
                routing table based on the method.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            After the correct routing table has been selected based on the request method we need to select the
            appropriate
            routing method based on the path of the request. The simplest way of doing this would be to map each of the
            above paths to its own routing function responsible for getting and, for the lights, setting the values.
            Whether an appropriate solution or not depends on how the actual communication with the temperature sensors
            and the lights is performed.
            The details of the mapping between the routing
            table
            and the data model are left to your discretion, but the following routing extension present in many web
            application frameworks.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Suggestion: route parameters</h4>
            <p>
                Allow for named URL segments, <code>:[a-zA-Z_]+</code>, in the paths in the routing table. The names
                are used to create a parameter mapping from the given identifiers and the corresponding parts of the
                request path.
                For instance, matching the request path <code>/kitchen/lights/stove</code> with the route path
                <code>/:room/lights/:light</code> would be successful and create the mapping:
                <code>{ "room" : "kitchen", "light" : "stove" }</code>. This allows for the association of any number
                of similar paths to one handler with the parameters passed by storing the parameters in the
                <em>params</em>
                property on the request object.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Using route parameters its easy to map request paths to a mock-up data model and deliver the right response.
        </p>


        <!-- client -->

        <h3>The client</h3>
        <p>
            The web application is accessed using the <code>/</code> request path. This serves the applications
            main page. In the <a href="https://dva446.herokuapp.com/lab2/exercise1">example</a>,
            the temperature is displayed as a <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/badge/">badge</a> on
            the
            header displaying the room name, and the lights are represented as <a
                href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/buttons/">buttons</a>, where the color of the button
            indicates whether the light is on or off.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
            <p>
                Feel free to reuse the example design, or experiment with

            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>GETing the values of the temperature sensors and the lights</h4>
        <p>
            In addition to HTML content, the page contains JavaScript used to communicate with the server. The example
            solution uses a <code>refresh</code>
            function that is set to be called every 5 seconds. The <code>refresh</code> function uses
            two tables that map element identifiers of the controls to the associated
            paths. For each identifier a GET request to the corresponding path, which results in a JSON
            encoding of the value of the device.
        </p>

            <h4 class="alert-heading">Suggestion: JQuery getJSON</h4>
            <p>
                While you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a>
                to perform the GET and <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse">JSON.parse</a>
                to parse the result, you can consider using <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> to perform both
                actions in one,
                in particular <a href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/">jQuery.getJSON()</a>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>POSTing to the lights</h4>

        <p>
            In the example solution, the <code>click</code> event is handled by the <code>clickLight</code> handler
            passing the identifier of the element as parameter. The <code>clickLight</code> handler uses the identifier
            to find the corresponding path and POSTs an empty request. The server handles the POST request and responds
            with the new state of the light, used by the client to update the display.

                to perform the POST, you can consider using <a
                    href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/">JQuery.post()</a>
                to perform it.

            <p>
                The JQuery
                included with Bootstrap is JQuery <em>slim</em>, which excludes AJAX. Hence, if you want to use JQuery
                you need to replace it with the full JQuery release. See <a href="https://jquery.com/download/">Downloading

        <h4>Updating the client display</h4>

        <p>
            After having received a response from the server from a GET or a POST request, the client should update the
            display of the
            device associated with the path, i.e., the HTML element identified by the identifier in the example
            solution.
            This element can be fetched by
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById">Document.getElementByID</a>
            and updated accordingly.

        <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
            <p>
                Instead of Document.getElementByID, the
                example solution uses the jQuery <a href="https://api.jquery.com/id-selector/">ID Selector</a> to
                get the element associated
                with an identifier. To set the text on the <code>span</code> displaying the
                temperature the jQuery <a href="http://api.jquery.com/text/">.text()</a> function is used, and
                to change the status of the lights the class of the <code>button</code> representing the
                light is changed using the jQuery <a href="http://api.jquery.com/attr/">.attr()</a> function.

        <h2>Adding authentication and authorization</h2>

        <p>
            The @home application we have created thus far contains no authentication. If we were to make this
            application
            available online anyone could use it to read the status of the home and even control it. This is clearly not
            a good idea!
        </p>

        <p>
            To remedy the situation we need to add authentication (and authorization) to our application. Authentication
            is the process of establishing the identity of the user, while authorization is the process of verifying
            that a user is allowed to perform a certain action. Your task is to create a web application that behaves similarly to the <a
                href="https://dva446.herokuapp.com/lab2/exercise2">example application</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this exercise, we will attempt to craft our own authentication and authorization mechanism
            adhering to
            the following authentication and authorization flow:

        <ul>
            <li>All resources apart from the login page should only be available to authenticated users.</li>
            <li>All resources should be available to all users, simplifying authorization to verifying that a user is
                authenticated.
            </li>
            <li>Failed authorization should forward the client to the login page.</li>
            <li>The login page should allow the user to authenticate by providing a username and password pair.</li>
            <li>Successful authentication should result in the creation of a new session identified by a unique session
                identifier.
            </li>
            <li>The server should keep enough session state to be able to authorize access, i.e., in this case, it
                suffices to record that
                the session is valid.
            </li>
            <li>The session identifier should be sent back to the client and passed to the server in subsequent
                requests,
                acting as a form of authentication token.
            </li>
            <li>On the reception of a session identifier as part of a request, the server should grant access to the
                resource if the
                session identifier belongs to a valid session.
            </li>
            <li>It should be possible to log out. Logging out should invalidate the active session as identified by the
                request.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Protecting the communication</h3>

        <p>
            Similar to the Basic HTTP authorization we will send the authentication information and session information
            in clear text to the server. This means that we will have to rely on some means to protect the communication
            with the server, e.g., SSL/TLS.
        </p>

        <h4>Creating an HTTPS server</h4>


        <p>
            Creating an HTTPS server in node.js is relatively easy: all that is required is to import <code>https</code>
            instead of <code>http</code> and provide the server with a signed certificate and a private key. To obtain
            a signed certificate one has to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and pass it to a
            Certificate Authority (CA) for signing. In our situation, however, this is not possible: CAs only sign
            proper domain names and not local unroutable
            addresses such as localhost (127.0.0.1) which we use to run web applications. The solution is a
            self-signed certificate, where we use our own private key to sign the CSR. <a
                href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> provides a
            <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self">short howto</a> detailing how to create
            self-signed certificates. The generated secret key <code>server.key</code> and certificate
            <code>server.crt</code>
            are both in <em>.pem</em> format and can be given as options to the server on start. We add those to a
            <code>cert</code> directory creating the following application structure.
        </p>

        <table class="table">
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">Path</th>
                <th scope="col">Description</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>cert/</strong></td>
                <td><strong>SSL certificate and secret key.</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>public/</td>
                <td>Directory with static files served by the static fallback.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>templates/</td>
                <td>Directory with template files. Used to render HTML responses.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>httpd.js</td>
                <td>The web application implementation.</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
            Once we have the certificate and the private key we can create an HTTPS server as follows.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('cert/server.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('cert/server.crt')
};

https.createServer(options, (req, res) => {
  ...
}).listen(8000);</code></pre>


        <p>
            Note that since the certificate is self-signed it's not going to be trusted by the browser, which will
            complain about an
            untrusted site. You can bypass this warning to continue to load the page. The exact way of doing this
            depends on the browser - in Chrome it is under <em>ADVANCED</em>. After you have bypassed the warning, reloading the page should not trigger it again
            (but, e.g., closing the tab or the window most likely will). Note that Chrome warns that the connection is
            <em>Not Secure</em>, since the certificate cannot be verified.
        </p>

            <p>
                If you are working with a proper domain name you can get a free certificate for that domain via, e.g.,
                <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>. Let's Encrypt will require you to prove you are
                the rightful owner of the domain, and the result is a certificate that is trusted by the browsers.

        <h3>Session handling</h3>
        <p>
            As is common, we will use HTTP <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies">Cookies</a>
            to carry the session information.Cookies are a form of simple client-side storage associating a name
            with a value. We will use a cookie <code>athome-session</code> to carry
            the session information for the @home application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cookies are set by
            a special <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie">Set-Cookie</a>
            response
            header and are automatically sent back by the client as a special
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cookie">Cookie</a> request header in
            each subsequent request to the same server
            (subject to domain, path and time restrictions). This makes cookies a simple choice
            for implementing rudimentary session-based authentication and authorization.
        </p>

        <p>
            On successful login, a new session unique session identifier is allocated. This can be done in several ways
            with different pros and cons. In this exercise we will select the simplest possible and let the
            server use consecutive session identifiers, starting from one and incrementing by one for each
            new session. On allocation, the session identifiers are stored in the memory of the server for use in
            subsequent authorizations.
        </p>


        <h3>Authorization</h3>

        <p>
            When a protected resource is accessed the server looks for the <code>athome-session</code> cookie in the
            cookie header of the request. If the cookie is found and contains a valid session identifier access is
            granted. Otherwise, access is denied and the client should be forwarded to the login page.
        </p>

        <p>
            Forwarding to a login page can be done by crafting a response using the
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302">302</a> response code
            containing a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location">Location</a>
            header pointing to the target page. In our case we want to forward to <code>/login</code>, which returns
            the login page.
        </p>

        <p>
            To find the <code>athome-session</code> cookie the server needs to parse the cookie header, which is
            available as <code>headers.cookie</code> on the request object. Parsing of the cookie can be done by using
            the node.js <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie">cookie</a> library. This library contains
            a <code>parse</code> function that takes the contents of the cookie header and gives back an object
            representing the parsed cookies. Adding the cookie library to the application with <a
                href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a> creates the
            following application structure.
        </p>

        <table class="table">
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">Path</th>

                <td>Directory with template files. Used to render HTML responses.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>The web application implementation.</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h4>What to protect?</h4>

        <p>
            Which application endpoints should be protected? It depends. Clearly, the main page and the sensor endpoints
            should be protected, while the <code>/login</code> endpoint must not be protected (otherwise, we can't log in!).
            This entails that (some of) the static files under <em>public</em> must also not be protected since the
            <code>/login</code> endpoint makes use of them. For simplicity, we let all the files in public be unprotected -
            indeed, if we want to serve protected static files we better put them in a different directory and modify
            the static server accordingly. In summary, below follows an overview of the protection status of the
            different endpoints.
        </p>

        <table class="table">
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">Endpoints</th>
                <th scope="col">Protection status</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>static files</td>
                <td>Unprotected</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>/, /kitchen/*, /livingroom/*, /bedroom/*, /logout</td>
                <td>Protected</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>/login</td>
                <td>Unprotected</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>The implementation details of the endpoint protection are left to your discretion.</p>


        <h3>Logging in</h3>

        <p>
            We add a GET handler for <code>/login</code> to serve the login page, which contains an HTML form with an
            input for the username and one for the password in addition to a login button. We set the form to POST
            the content to <code>/login</code>.
        </p>

        <img src="exercise2/athome-login.png" class="img-responsive">

        <p>
            To handle the login requests we add a POST handler for <code>/login</code> on the server. The POST handler
            reads the credentials from the body of the request and verifies it against its own records. If the
            credentials match, the server responds with a <code>302</code> redirect to <code>/</code> passing
            <code>Set-Cookie</code> header that sets <code>athome-session</code> to the fresh session identifier.
            If the credentials don't match, the server returns a version of the login page, where an error message is
            displayed.
        </p>


        <img src="exercise2/athome-login-failed.png" class="img-responsive">


        <h4>Storing user credentials</h4>

        <p>
            In order for the server to be able to verify a login request, the server needs access to user credentials.
            For simplicity, we store the username, password pairs as properties in an object, where each property
            corresponds to a username and stores the password, e.g.,
            <code>{ 'daniel' : 'fisksoppa' }</code>.
            We store the credentials object JSON encoded in the <code>passwd</code> file,
            creating the following application structure.
        </p>

        <table class="table">
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">Path</th>
                <th scope="col">Description</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>cert/</td>
                <td>SSL certificate and secret key.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>public/</td>
                <td>Directory with static files served by the static fallback.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>node_modules/</td>
                <td>Directory with installed libraries. Contains cookie if installed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>templates/</td>
                <td>Directory with template files. Used to render HTML responses.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>package-lock.json</td>
                <td>Automatically generated by NPM.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>passwd</strong></td>
                <td><strong>JSON encoded user information.</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>httpd.js</td>
                <td>The web application implementation.</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>


        <h3>Logging out</h3>

        <p>
            Compared to exercise 1 we modify the application main page to contain a logout button with an
            associated <code>onclick</code> handler that POSTs an empty message to <code>/logout</code>.
            Logout looks up the session cookie <code>athome-session</code> in the request and extracts the
            session identifier. Thereafter the session is invalidated by removing the session identifier from the
            collection of active
            sessions. When the POST request has finished the user is logged out and the client forwards to the
            <code>/login</code> page.
